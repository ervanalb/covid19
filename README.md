# COVID19

## Motivation

The Cambridge Health Alliance is [soliciting PPE donations](https://www.challiance.org/about/newsroom/personal_protective_equipment_ppe_donations_1179), and MGH wants [3D printed masks](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/coronavirus/mgh-desperately-needs-supplies-president-says/2094292/).

3D printing masks and respirators is [sketchy at best](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/from-design-to-mass-3d-printing-of-medical-shields-in-three-days/) so it looks like glasses and face shields are a much better plan.

Prusa has a [great mask design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP7z3iw76GA), as does [Budmen Industries](https://budmen.com/). It seems like Budmen is a good platform to coordinate through, though I would prefer to talk straight to local hospitals and nurses so that I can produce the highest impact goods.

I think there's a fairly high chance that none of these get used. The need for masks is definitely way more critical than shields, and shields can probably be wiped down and reused much more effectively. But CHA is actively asking for them, and this is very low cost to me, so I'll take the gamble. I am currently healthy and have some 3D printers, and a passing interest in manufacturing, so let's give this a shot.

## Goals

Produce PPE and other emergency equipment for local hospitals who have run out of official equipment.

Attempt to produce the highest impact goods, as determined by

* Hospital need
* Likeliness to work (be safe and effective)

## Face Shields

I'm going to start with face shields because they seem like a superset of safety glasses. My goal is to produce around 200 units, but this may change after making initial deliveries and getting feedback on current needs.

### Capital equipment

[X] FDM printer with 130mm x 130mm bed
[X] [Adjustable three hole punch](https://www.amazon.com/Swingline-Precision-Adjustable-Capacity-74037/dp/B0006HUPHU) (or single hole punch + jig)

### Consumables

[X] [ABS plastic](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J0H6NNM) (10-20g estimated) (white preferred to show contamination)
[ ] [Overhead transparency film](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F45YXJD) (1 sheet)
[ ] [Elastic strap for back](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KSRCLKK) (5 - 10 inches estimated)
[X] [Gallon ziploc bag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BJ495GL) (packaging for final product and prevent contamination) (1 bag)

*Note: These are all links to Amazon. I intend to acquire the missing materials locally if possible. I have put in an order as a backup plan, but deliveries are quite slow right now.*

### Design

The basic design will be the same as others are doing: a 3D-printed headpiece secured by elastic, which holds a transparent sheet by means of three or so holes in the sheet.

I wish I could just use the Budmen design, but it will not fit in my print bed. I will likely have to create a new design to fit on my small print bed, or a two-part design. I will upload the files here when they are ready.

### Manufacturing

I will probably only be able to fit one part on my 3D printer at a time. I'll try to eliminate the use of raft to speed up the print and conserve materials.

The three-hole punch will come in handy to mass-produce the plastic parts. The three holes have to be on the narrow side of the plastic, so make sure your punch can adjust to do that. I anticipate the spacing of the holes being very important.

### Sterilization

There isn't really hope of complete sterilization with this home manufacturing process. However, it appears that coronaviruses [don't like temperatures above 56Â°C](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/survival_2003_05_04/en/). This means that baking the finished goods (in sealed bags) in a low temperature oven ought to destroy any virus particles hanging around. I'll put the exact specs here once I get to this step.

### Delivery

I don't have a car but I have a bike trailer!

## Safety Glasses

I'm definitely starting with masks, but once that line is up and running I'll probably design some glasses.

I see a few benefits to glasses:

* Less material use (can produce more with limited resources)
* Faster turn time
* CHA is explicitly asking for them, unlike face masks

but we'll see how things play out over the next week or so.
